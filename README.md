# About Fonts
Khmer font is very important for students who want to learn computer in the Cambodia. It helps children read and write in the Khmer language on the computer. When students have Khmer font, they can type homework, read lessons, and practice using technology in their own language. This helps them learn better and feel more confident.

We are not the owner of this font. We share it only for education, not for selling or making money. We want to help children in poor villages who need Khmer font to learn computer skills. If the real owner has any problem, we respect their rights and can give credit or remove the font if needed.
